Description: Documentation system for C, C++, Java, Python and other languages
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL
 and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.  It can generate an on-line class browser
 (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of
 documented source files. There is also support for generating man pages
 and for converting the generated output into Postscript, hyperlinked PDF
 or compressed HTML.  The documentation is extracted directly from the sources.
 .

Description: multi-language source code parser based on Doxygen
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL
 and to some extent PHP, C#, and D. Doxyparse builds on doxygen's great source
 code parsing infrastructure and provides a command-line tool that can be used
 to obtain information from source code, such as:
 .
  * which functions/methods and variables/attributes a module/class contains
  * which functions/methods calls/uses which functions/methods/variables
  * etc
 .
 doxyparses's main goal is to be used by higher-level source code analysis
 tools.
 .
 This package contains doxyparse binary, a source code parser based on Doxygen
